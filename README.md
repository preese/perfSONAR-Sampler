# perfSONAR-Sampler
All in one project to show how to get started with perfSONAR all the way to MaDDash grids.

After using perfSONAR for a number of years, I still struggled to understand many of the nuances.  I started just using the 'Toolkit' features and have had one stood up for years testing to a few other places and many tests being requested from outside.  At a conference one year the idea of the MaDDash grid was shown and my mouth dropped.  How could I get that at my University?  The answer was simple, just read the docs, its all in there.

While it is, in fact, true, that all the bits are included in the lengthy docs even after multiple reviews of the docs, page by page, I still really didn't have any idea of how to weave all the bits together.

After more passes through the docs, I noticed a posting from Andy Lake, lead developer on the perfSONAR project about a one page step by step process for getting a MaDDash grid up and running.  Sure enough this did work and I was so happy to see my first maddash-webui page full of little squares turning from orange to green at time past.

The idea would be to show how to very quickly get a working Maddash setup working and allow any perfSONAR interested persons to then see how all the pieces worked together to make a bigger, more robust monitoring system themselves.  That is my hope for the project.  What follows next are the steps needed to get this mini system installed and working!
